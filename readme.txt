A plugin that adds a customizable and filterable email subscription widget and shortcode for posts.

== Description ==

OSD Subscribe is a simple and highly flexible email subscription plugin. OSD Subscribe allows you to modify the content 
before and after the subscription form, create pages for subscription confirmation and unsubscription, modify error
and success messages, completely customize the email templates, and have different subscription forms for 
different categories on different parts of your site. OSD Subscribe can be used as a widget or as a shortcode, 
so there is no place this plugin can't go. In addition, OSD Subscribe provides a filter for users to completely customize
the layout of the form.
